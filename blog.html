            <br />Hey friend, we hope you are having a great start of the week!
            Here in California we just started feeling the fall and the weather
            is getting more chill.<br /><br />This week we want to talk about
            all the reasons why we think we are creating something unique for
            all of us.<br /><br />SAVEE was created by passionate immigrants who
            care deeply about craft. Period.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not a secret in our creative industry that SAVEE is way better
            than Pinterest to find inspiration. With no ads and a more
            sophisticated user interface, SAVEE stands out as a far better
            solution that will help creatives save tons of time.
          </p>

            Here is a breakdown of why we think you find inspiration faster on
            SAVEE.<br />
          </h2>
          <p>
            <br /><strong>1 - Get inspired by the best</strong><br />With almost
            1M users, SAVEE attracts talented people from different fields, like
            design, motion, architecture, and fashion. Many tastemakers are
            using SAVEE to share what inspires them.

            <strong>2 - High quality content</strong><br />Often people ask why
            everything on SAVEE looks stunning — and the reason is that we have
            a high level of human curation, combining years of saving a wide
            range of images, that vary from digital to physical products. Every
            time you open our product a wall of beauty hits you.

            <strong>3 - Find inspiration faster</strong><br />With a
            fast-loading feed (which takes about 2 seconds to be shown), search
            by color, and a streamlined approach to boards, SAVEE helps you find
            high-quality inspiration in a fraction of the time, which would take
            you longer in other platforms.
