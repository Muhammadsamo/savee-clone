                <br />Hey friend, we hope you are having a great start of the
                week! Here in California we just started feeling the fall and
                the weather is getting more chill.<br /><br />This week we want
                to talk about all the reasons why we think we are creating
                something unique for all of us.<br /><br />SAVEE was created by
                passionate immigrants who care deeply about craft. Period.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not a secret in our creative industry that SAVEE is way
                better than Pinterest to find inspiration. With no ads and a
                more sophisticated user interface, SAVEE stands out as a far
                better solution that will help creatives save tons of time.

                Here is a breakdown of why we think you find inspiration faster
                on SAVEE.<br />
              </h2>
              <p>
                <br /><h3>1 - Get inspired by the best</h3><br />With
                almost 1M users, SAVEE attracts talented people from different
                fields, like design, motion, architecture, and fashion. Many
                tastemakers are using SAVEE to share what inspires them.

                <h3>2 - High quality content</h3><br />Often people ask
                why everything on SAVEE looks stunning â€” and the reason is that
                we have a high level of human curation, combining years of
                saving a wide range of images, that vary from digital to
                physical products. Every time you open our product a wall of
                beauty hits you.

                <h3>3 - Find inspiration faster</h3><br />With a
                fast-loading feed (which takes about 2 seconds to be shown),
                search by color, and a streamlined approach to boards, SAVEE
                helps you find high-quality inspiration in a fraction of the
                time, which would take you longer in other platforms.
