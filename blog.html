              <br />Hey friend, we hope you are having a great start of the
              week! Here in California we just started feeling the fall and the
              weather is getting more chill.<br /><br />This week we want to
              talk about all the reasons why we think we are creating something
              unique for all of us.<br /><br />SAVEE was created by passionate
              immigrants who care deeply about craft. Period.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not a secret in our creative industry that SAVEE is way
              better than Pinterest to find inspiration. With no ads and a more
              sophisticated user interface, SAVEE stands out as a far better
              solution that will help creatives save tons of time.

              <br /><strong>1 - Get inspired by the best</strong><br />With
              almost 1M users, SAVEE attracts talented people from different
              fields, like design, motion, architecture, and fashion. Many
              tastemakers are using SAVEE to share what inspires them.

              <strong>2 - High quality content</strong><br />Often people ask
              why everything on SAVEE looks stunning â€” and the reason is that we
              have a high level of human curation, combining years of saving a
              wide range of images, that vary from digital to physical products.
              Every time you open our product a wall of beauty hits you.

              <strong>3 - Find inspiration faster</strong><br />With a
              fast-loading feed (which takes about 2 seconds to be shown),
              search by color, and a streamlined approach to boards, SAVEE helps
              you find high-quality inspiration in a fraction of the time, which
              would take you longer in other platforms.
